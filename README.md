# C++ Program 3

An assignment designed to introduce basic control flow and error handling in C++.

## Overview

This repository contains a C++ program that demonstrates fundamental control flow structures and basic error handling mechanisms. It's intended as an introductory exercise for beginners to practice essential C++ programming concepts.

## Features

- Utilizes conditional statements (`if`, `else`) to control program flow
- Demonstrates basic error handling using input validation techniques

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC)
- A code editor or IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code, CLion, Code::Blocks)

### Compilation and Execution
